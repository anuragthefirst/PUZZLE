v0.0 - 2011-07-18

- first release (not announced), contains 5 puzzles (nurikabe, akari, heyawake,
  hitori and picross).

TODO next version

- added more games: hashiwokakero, masyu and slitherlink.
- quick fix so that the graphics work under gnu/linux. bytes per pixel was
  changed from 1 to 4, and this is the only mode supported.
- fixed black screen when resizing windows in verify mode.

the program will only reach v1.0 when the following is in place

- menu system with puzzle selector and score tracking.
- automatic scanning of puzzles (on first time run), user-triggable scan for
  new puzzles
- every feature should run on windows and gnu/linux, and hopefully on mac
  (which i cannot test)

further version numbers will be the harmonic numbers H_2, H_3 etc. the number
of digits after the decimal point will be the least possible such that only
one harmonic number exists in the interval [v-0.5*d, v+0.5*d] where v is the
version number and d is the number of digits after the decimal point in the
version number. in addition, the version should be correctly rounded to the
required number of digits after the decimal point. for instance v1 is illegal
as both and 1.5 fits in [0.5, 1.5]. The first few legal version numbers are
v1.0, v1.5, v1.8 and v2.1.
