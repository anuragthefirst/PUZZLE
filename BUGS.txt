bugs and setbacks

general:
- when a messagebox is active, redraw events are not processed, so resizing
  (for example) is messed up.

heyawake:
- solver doesn't clean up after itself. solve hey005.txt and hey004.txt in
  order and solver will reach an illegal position early in hey004.txt.
  another manifestation: solve heyR0290, then heyR0291, then heyR0289 and
  program crashes
- not a bug as such, but a weakness: the solver can't solve heyR0296 which is
  supposed to be a very easy level

minesweeper:
- solver or game doesn't clean up. solve mineR0090.txt and mineR0091.txt in
  order and solver cannot find any move in R0091.txt. check if minesleft has
  something to do with it

picross:
- solver freezes on illegal boards
- investigate why solver is slow in the presence of yellow on R0806

kuromasu:
- solver can't solve R0234 after solving some of the previous levels. it needs
  not be related to the other solver bugs which seem to be a problem with
  reentrance. this solver has some tricky routines

akari:
- solver fails on R0031 if R0030 is solved first
- easier case: solve C132 first, then it fails to do R0005 even though there's
  an easy unfilled at 10,2

hashiwokakero:
- solver fails hard on any second solver attempt on the C levels
