bugs and setbacks

general:
- when a messagebox is active, redraw events are not processed, so resizing
  (for example) is messed up.
- when in anykeypress, redraw doesn't draw the fancy colours.

nurikabe:
- FIXED (puzzles re-gained by adding another heuristic)
  fixing the bug in level4connectborder resulted in losing R0329 and R0555.

picross:
- solver freezes on illegal boards
