bugs and setbacks

general:
- when a messagebox is active, redraw events are not processed, so resizing
  (for example) is messed up.
- when in anykeypress, redraw doesn't draw the fancy colours.

picross:
- solver freezes on illegal boards
- investigate why solver is slow in the presence of yellow on R0806
