akari: (1 unsolved)
- playable, done
- solver is fantastic and fast (not solved: X01)

picross (4/1392 unsolved)
- playable, seems to be done
- solver is good and fast (not solved: R0583 R0642 R1183 R1447)

minesweeper (5/119 unsolved)
- playable, done
- solved is decent (not solved: R0090 R0105 R0106 R0107 R0109),
  all unsolved depend on mines left

heyawake (6 unsolved)
- playable, done
- solver is fantastic, but slow (not solved: R0108 R0128 R0129 R0154 R0250
  R0297)

hitori (14 unsolved)
- playable, done
- solver is poor, but fast (not solved: C008 C014 C019 C032 C045 C059 C118
  C135 R0077 R0078 R0599 R0609 S08 S10)

nurikabe (16 unsolved)
- playable, done
- solver is decent (not solved: 003 005 047 055 056 059 065 066 069 076
  R0029 R0400 R0499 R0500 R0559 R0583)
- number of unsolved levels is high since i've gone out of my way to find hard
  puzzles on the net. this does not necessarily mean that this solver is worse
  than the other games' solvers

masyu:
- playable, done
- solver is decent and fast (not solved: C028 C069 C090 C099 C109 23*R)

slitherlink:
- playable, done
- solver is good and fast (not solved: C024, and a bunch of R)

NOTES ON SOME UNSOLVED LEVELS

akari
- X01 is a special level encoding a boolean expression, which is part of an
  NP-completeness proof. we cannot expect to solve with level with human-
  like heuristics

nurikabe
- 003 is just very hard, solved needs to see that the 51 island must be
  compacted to allow the upper left wall to connect along upper/right border
- 005 is extremely hard, need some advanced heuristics that are beyond me as
  for now
- 047 is not too hard, but solver needs to be able to handle very large
  islands, and maybe a "negative" heuristic that considers leftmost walls
  if there are only a few left to place
- 055 is very easy, but silly
- 056 has a detailed walkthrough: http://fabpedigree.com/nurikabe/nuriks01.htm
- 066 has a detailed walkthrough: http://fabpedigree.com/nurikabe/nuriks11.htm
- R0029 is very easy, but silly
