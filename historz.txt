v1.5 will not be released until the following is in place:

further version numbers will be the harmonic numbers H_2, H_3 etc. the number
of digits after the decimal point will be the least possible such that only
one harmonic number exists in the interval [v-0.5*10^-d, v+0.5*10^-d] where v is the
version number and d is the number of digits after the decimal point in the
version number. in addition, the version should be correctly rounded to the
required number of digits after the decimal point. for instance v1 is illegal
as both and 1.5 fits in [0.5, 1.5]. The first few legal version numbers are
v1.0, v1.5, v1.8 and v2.1.
